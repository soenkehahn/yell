0.2:

  - add source comments?  haddock vs. executables?
  - more practically useful patterns
  - shorter sounds

0.3:

  - how do we switch between ghc and ghci with symlinks?  does both work?
      make dedicated 'yell' PATH entry.
      feed lots of symlinks there.
      make mapping of symlink names to target executables configurable.
      default rule: look up name in path, excluding yell entry in path.  (how does that work?)

0.4:

  - if target sound is a list of paths and/or contains wild cards, play any of the named sound files at random.
    (or name one directory, and all files inside, recursively, will be played?  seems cleaner..)

later:

  - more complex parser rules (multi-line, parsec *or* regexp)
  - extend to other environments.  (chicken scheme?  something
    non-compilery?  tcpdump?  also make config language work with
    arbitrary number of envs.)
  - give all output lines of playcmd a meaningful prefix on stdout / stderr.
  - debug output (to log file?) containing the command lines for playing sounds and stdout/stderr of the process.
